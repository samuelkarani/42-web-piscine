The Class’ constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are
required:

	- ’preset’:
		the matrix type to, mandatory. The value must be one of the Class
		constants previoulsy defined.

	- ’scale’:
		the scale factor, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth SCALE.

	- ’angle’:
		the rotation angle in radians, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth RX,
		RY or RZ.

	- ’vtc’:
		translation vector, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth TRANSLATION.

	- ’fov’:
		projection field of view in degrees mandatory when ’preset’ is worth
		PROJECTION.

	- ’ratio’:
		projected image ratio, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.

	- ’near’:
		projection’s near clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’ is worth
		PROJECTION.

	- ’far’:
		projection’s far clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’ is worth
		PROJECTION.


The Matrix Class must has the following public methods:

Matrix    mult( Matrix $rhs ) :
returns the multiplication of both matrices.

Vertex    transformVertex( Vertex $vtx ) :
returns a new vertex resulting from the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
